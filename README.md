#Poseidon - web publishing for everyone.

####The core Poseidon package documentation

##Install
	npm install
	
##Build
The build system is based on [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com).

##Test
The following command will run tests within the `test` folder using [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/).

	gulp test

A coverage report will be available, thanks to [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) in the folder `coverage/`

##Coding standards	
* indent with tabs
* indent size is 2
* install [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for your IDE in order to be consistent. The default `.editorconfig` file is already in the root folder
* double quotes instead of single ones

##TODO
* Core documentation has to be written
* Source comments use jsdoc 

##Next steps
* start developing the logger module, but tests before
